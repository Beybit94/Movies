# Movies

Simple movies app for architectural experiments.

## Architectures

- **[MVVMR](https://github.com/gokselkoksal/Movies/tree/mvvmr)**: Extension to MVVM which introduces a VIPER-like router and uses principles from Redux for communication between view model and view controller.

- **[Core](https://github.com/gokselkoksal/Movies/tree/core)**: Core helps you design applications in a way that the app flow is driven by business layer, instead of UI layer. It also promotes unidirectional data flow between components for consistency, high testability and powerful debugging. Core can be seen as a Redux, Flux and MVVM hybrid.
